# ✈️ Flight Price Data Analysis — Python

This project contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a large flight price dataset.  
The goal of the analysis is to understand how different factors influence flight prices and identify patterns within the data.

---

## 📘 Overview
The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and analyzed using Python.  
Key tasks included handling missing values, converting date/time columns, formatting data types, and exploring relationships between airlines, routes, durations, and ticket prices.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing or inconsistent records  
- Converted date, time, and duration fields into usable formats  
- Standardized categorical columns  
- Checked for duplicates and corrected data formatting issues

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed analysis to understand:

- Price variation across different airlines  
- How flight duration impacts pricing  
- Trends based on source → destination routes  
- Effect of number of stops on ticket prices  
- Distribution of flight prices across the entire dataset  

Created visualizations to compare:

- Airline vs Price  
- Stops vs Price  
- Route patterns  
- Duration vs Price
