# ✈️ Flight Price Data Analysis — Python

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large flight price dataset.  
The objective is to understand how different travel-related factors influence ticket prices by cleaning, preparing, and analyzing the dataset in depth.

---

## 📘 Overview
The dataset required extensive preprocessing due to inconsistent formats, mixed data types, and large volume.  
The analysis focused on understanding patterns related to airlines, routes, stops, durations, and pricing through detailed data exploration.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed:

- Identified and removed missing or incomplete records  
- Converted date, time, and duration columns into consistent formats  
- Standardized airline, source, destination, and route fields  
- Split and cleaned complex text-based columns  
- Detected and removed duplicates  
- Corrected datatype issues across multiple columns

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA focused on understanding:

- How ticket prices vary among different airlines  
- Differences in price across routes  
- Influence of number of stops on ticket pricing  
- Relationship between flight duration and price  
- General distribution and range of flight prices in the dataset  

*Note: EDA was performed using statistical summaries and column-level exploration, without visualizations.*
